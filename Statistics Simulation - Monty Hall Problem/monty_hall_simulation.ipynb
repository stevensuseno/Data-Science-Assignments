    "Suppose you're on a game show and you're given the choice of three doors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. The car and the goats were placed randomly behind the doors before the show.\n",

    "The game show host, Monty Hall, who knows what is behind the doors, now has to open one of the two remaining doors, and the door he opens must have a goat behind it. If both remaining doors have goats behind them, he chooses one randomly. \n",
    "\n",
    "After Monty opens a door with a goat, he will ask you to decide whether you want to stay with your first choice or to switch to the last remaining door. \n",
    "Imagine that you chose Door 1 and the host opens Door 3, which has a goat. \n",
    "He then asks you \"Do you want to switch to Door Number 2?\" Is it to your advantage to change your choice? \n",

    "**NOTES:**\n",
    "1. The player may initially choose any of the three doors (not just Door 1).\n",
    "2. The host opens a different door revealing a goat (not necessarily Door 3).\n",
    "3. The host gives the player a second choice between the two remaining unopened doors. \n"
