    "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that assumes returns on a portfolio are normally distributed.  Suppose a portfolio has an average annual return of 14.7% (i.e., an average gain on 14.7%) with a standard deviation of 33%.  A return of 0% means the value of the portfolio doesn't change, a negative return means that the portfolio loses money, and a positive return means that the portfolio gains money. Determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What percentage of years does this portfolio lose money, (i.e. have a return less than 0%)?\n",
